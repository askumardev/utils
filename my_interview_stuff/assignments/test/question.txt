The route admin/students.csv?export_type=students in the Dashboard application returns a CSV 
file with data from the student model. The export used to work with 10,000 or less records in the 
student model. But now that there are over 26,000 records, the export crashes, 
consumes too much CPU and doesn't finish.
See https://github.com/lumerit/dashboard-example/blob/master/app/exports/student_export.rb for a starting point.

How would suggest refactoring the code so that the export finishes?

divide the 26000 records into batches
take each batch and insert into csv by one batch at a time

Straming or piping makes faster.
